# Streamlined Data Pipeline POC

## Description

In this proof of concept (POC) project, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of a streamlined data pipeline for seamless data processing, integration, and analysis. Leveraging modern ETL techniques and cloud-based infrastructure, we'll showcase how this optimized pipeline accelerates data ingestion, transformation, and loading.

## Key Objectives

1. **Efficient Data Ingestion:** Evaluate the speed and efficiency of data ingestion from multiple sources, including APIs, databases, and flat files.

2. **Real-time Processing:** Implement real-time processing capabilities to handle high-velocity data streams for immediate insights.

3. **Data Quality Assurance:** Integrate data quality checks and validations to ensure accuracy and reliability of the processed data.

4. **Scalability and Performance:** Assess the scalability of the pipeline to handle large volumes of data without compromising performance.

5. **Automated Orchestration:** Implement automation for pipeline orchestration, scheduling, and monitoring to minimize manual intervention.

6. **Data Integration and Enrichment:** Showcase the capability to integrate diverse data sets, enriching them with relevant contextual information.

7. **Visualization and Reporting:** Generate insightful visualizations and reports from the processed data to facilitate informed decision-making.

## Technology Stack

- **ETL Framework:** Apache Airflow
- **Data Processing:** Apache Spark
- **Data Storage:** Azure,AWS
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes, Docker
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana
- **Visualization:** Power BI

## Expected Outcomes

- Demonstrated reduction in data processing time by [X]%.
- Improved data quality with a decrease in anomalies by [Y]%.
- Scalability tested up to [Z]TB of data per day.
- Real-time processing achieving an average latency of [A] seconds.
